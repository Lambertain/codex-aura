- **Error Reports**: Error messages and stack traces to help us identify and fix issues

### What Data We DON'T Collect

- Your actual code or file contents
- Personal information or identifiers
- File names or paths
- Any sensitive data from your codebase

### Data Storage and Usage

- All data is anonymized and aggregated
- Data is used only for improving the extension
- We do not share telemetry data with third parties
- Data is stored securely and deleted after analysis

### Opting Out
